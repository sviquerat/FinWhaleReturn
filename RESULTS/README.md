# Large aggregations of fin whales at Southern Ocean feeding grounds five decades after the end of commercial whaling
*Herr et al. 2022*

## Results
 Tables and model figures for the detection functionmodel diagnostics and abundance estimates.

- **Figure 2.png**: The detection function plot for the selected half-normal detection model (figure 2).
- **Table_2_det_function.xlsx**: Summary diagnostics of all tested detection models (table 2).
- **Table_3_gam_diagnostics.xlsx**: Summary diagnostics of generalised additive models(table 3).
- **Table_4_summary_abundance.xlsx**: Predicted fn whale abundance estimates (table 4).

 ##### There is a substantial amount of additional tables and figures in RESULTS\/_AUXILIARY which might provide insight into some decisions made during model selection for both the detection function and the additive model.
