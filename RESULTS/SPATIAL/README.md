# Return of large fin whale feeding aggregations to historical whaling grounds in the Southern Ocean
*Herr et al. 2022*

## Results
 These are the prediction rasters for the individual densities (fin whales / km²) as reported in the manuscript. The included rasters are:

- **PS_112_CV.tif**: The coefficient of variation per raster cell prediction on a scale of 0-100 %
- **PS_112_predicted density_mask.tif**: the predicted density of fin whales per km² within reasonable CV bounds (below 100% CV).
- **PS_112_predicted density_mask_95_lo.tif**: the lower 95% confidence interval of the predicted density of fin whales per km² within reasonable CV bounds (below 100% CV).
- **PS_112_predicted density_mask_95_hi.tif**: the upper 95% confidence interval of the predicted density of fin whales per km² within reasonable CV bounds (below 100% CV).

All rasters are based on the predictions of the selected additive model.

 ##### There is a substantial amount of additional tables and figures in RESULTS\/_AUXILIARY which might provide insight into some decisions made during model selection for both the detection function and the additive model.
