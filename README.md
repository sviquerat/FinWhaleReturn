# Density surface modelling analysis
 This is the main work flow to produce the figures and tables for the abundance estimation presented in Herr & Viquerat 2021 (Manuscript ID RSPB-2021-1229; submitted to Proc Roy B).
 
 Sripts are designed to run in sequence, i.e. starting with *00 - data prep.R* all the way through to *04 - summaries.R*.
 A number of tables and figures are created over the course of the analysis. File names have been adopted to reflect figure and table order as presented in the manuscript.
