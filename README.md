## Density surface modelling analysis
 This is the main work flow to produce the figures and tables for the abundance estimation presented in Herr et al. 2022.

 Sripts are designed to run in sequence, i.e. starting with *00 - data prep.R* all the way through to *04 - summaries.R*.
 A number of tables and figures are created over the course of the analysis. File names have been adopted to reflect figure and table order as presented in the manuscript. There is a substantial amount of additional tables and figures in RESULTS\_AUXILIARY which might provide insight into some decisions made during model selection for both the detection function and the additive model.
