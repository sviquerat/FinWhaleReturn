# Density surface modelling analysis
## Fin whale feeding aggregations suggest onset of population recovery 35 years after the end of commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean
 This is the main work flow to produce the figures and tables for the abundance estimation presented in Herr & Viquerat 2021 (Manuscript ID RSPB-2021-1229; submitted to Proc Roy B).
 
 Sripts are designed to run in sequence, i.e. starting with *00 - data prep.R* all the way through to *04 - summaries.R*.
 A number of tables and figures are created over the course of the analysis. File names have been adopted to reflect figure and table order as presented in the manuscript.
